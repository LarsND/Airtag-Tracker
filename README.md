# Airtag-Tracker
Script used to track airtags (using Apple's Find My-network through the Find My-app on macOS) and save the location history data to CSV files. Modified version of @icepick3000's AirtagAlex script. Starts and refreshes Find My in the background, instead of having to keep the window open. Keeps history logs for 30 days by default.
